Easily switch between 4G and 3G to save battery on your phone when you do not need the additional speed that 4G brings.

LTE (or 4G if you prefer) can be the number one cause of short battery life on the HTC Thunderbolt. Since there’s no clear way to switch it off, you may experience significantly short usage times. Or worse, if you live in an area without LTE coverage and can’t take advantage of it.

We have created a neat application that allows you to switch this on and off without remembering strange MMI codes.

All you need to do is download <a title="LTE Toggle" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.xorcode.ltetoggle" target="_blank">LTE Toggle</a> and follow these simple instructions:
<ol>
	<li>Click the button</li>
	<li>Select Phone Information</li>
	<li>Scroll down to Preferred Network Type</li>
	<li>Select "EvDo Only" or "CDMA Only" to disable LTE</li>
</ol>
To reactivate change it to "CDMA+LTE/EvDo auto."

Please let us know if you need any help using the application!
